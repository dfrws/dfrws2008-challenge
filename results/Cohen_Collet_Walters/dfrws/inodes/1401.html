<p align='center' style='text-align:center'/><font>The
Government of the 
United States of America</font>

Republic
 of 
Costa Rica<p/>
<p/><font>Desiring to
provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the repression
of crime; and</font><p/>
<p/><font>Desiring to
conclude a new Treaty for the reciprocal extradition of fugitives from justice,</font><p/>
<p/><font>Have agreed
as follows:</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 1
Obligation to Extradite</font><p/>
<p/><font>The
Contracting Parties agree to extradite to each other, subject to the provisions
in this Treaty, persons found in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties
who have been charged with, are being tried for, or have been found guilty of an
extraditable offense in the 

Requesting</font>
State
<p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 2
Extraditable Offenses</font><p/>
<p/><font>(1) An
offense shall be an extraditable offense if it may be punished under the laws of
both Contracting Parties by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of more
than one year or by any greater punishment.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(2) An
offense shall also be extraditable if it consists of an attempt to commit or
participation in the commission of any offense described in paragraph (1) of
this Article. Extradition shall also be granted for illicit association, as
provided by the laws of 
Costa Rica
, to commit any offense described in paragraph (1) of this Article, and for
conspiring as provided by the laws of the 

United States of America</font><p/>
<p/><font>(3) For the
purpose of this Article, an offense shall be an extraditable offense:</font><p/>
<p/><font>(a) Whether
or not the laws of the Contracting Parties place the offense within the same
category of offenses or denominate the offense by the same terminology; or</font><p/>
<p/><font>(b) Whether
or not the offense is one for which 
United States
 federal law requires, for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction in a 

United States

 federal court, proof of interstate transportation, or use of, or effect on, the
mails or other facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(4) When
extradition has been granted for an extraditable offense, it may also be granted
for any other offense specified in the request for extradition, even if the
other offense may be punished by less than one year's deprivation of liberty in
either State, provided that all other requirements for extradition are met. The 

Requesting
 
State

 shall submit the documentation required by Article 9 for each offense for which
extradition is requested pursuant to this paragraph.</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 3
Jurisdiction</font><p/>
<p/><font>Extradition
shall be granted for an extraditable offense regardless of where the act or acts
constituting the offense were committed.</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 4
Political and Military Offenses</font><p/>
<p/><font>(1)
Extradition shall not be granted when the offense for which extradition is
requested is a political offense or if the 

Requested</font>
State


Costa Rica
<p/>
<p/><font>(2) For the
purposes of this Treaty, the following offenses shall not be considered to be
included in paragraph (1) of this Article:</font><p/>
<p/><font>(a) The
murder or other willful crime against the life or physical integrity of a Head
of State or Head of Government or of his family, including attempts to commit
such an offense.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(b) An
offense with respect to which the Contracting Parties have the obligation to
prosecute or to grant extradition by reason of a multilateral international
agreement.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(3)
Extradition shall not be granted when the offense for which extradition is
requested is an offense of a purely military nature.</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 5
Capital Punishment</font><p/>
<p/><font>When the
offense for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the laws
of the Requesting State and the laws of the Requested State do not permit such
punishment for that offense, extradition may be refused, unless, before
extradition is granted, the Requesting State furnishes such assurances as the
Requested State considers sufficient, that the death penalty shall not be
imposed, or, if imposed, shall not be executed.</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 6
Prior Jeopardy for the Same Offense</font><p/>
<p/><font>(1)
Extradition shall not be granted when the person sought is being tried; has been
convicted, acquitted, or pardoned; or has served the sentence imposed by the
Requested State for the same offense arising out of the same acts for which
extradition is requested.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(2)
Extradition may be granted, however, even if the competent authorities of the 

Requested
 
State</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 7
Statute of Limitations</font><p/>
<p/><font>Extradition
shall not be granted when the prosecution or the enforcement of the penalty for
the offense for which extradition has been sought has become barred by lapse of
time pusuant to the laws of the 

Requesting</font>
State
<p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 8
Extradition of Nationals</font><p/>
<p/><font>(1) Neither
of the Contracting Parties shall be bound to surrender its nationals. The 
Requested
 
State</font>

Requested
 
State

 does not so preclude. In no event may either Contracting Party refuse to
extradite one of its nationals on the basis of nationality after the person's
nationality has been cancelled in accordance with the law of the 

Requested
State
<p/>
<p/><font>(2) The 

Requested
 
State

 shall undertake all available legal measures to suspend proceedings for the
naturalization of the person sought until a decision is made on the request for
extradition and, if that request is granted, until that person is surrendered.</font><p/>
<p/><font>(3) If the 
Requested
 
State</font>

Requesting
State


Requested
 
State

Requesting
 
State

 shall be informed of the result of its request.<p/>

Requested
 
State

 considers that the documents furnished in support of the request for the
extradition of a person sought are not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of
this Treaty, that State shall request the submission of necessary additional
documents. The 
Requested</font>
State
 may set a time limit for the submission of such documents, and may grant a
reasonable extension of the time limit upon application of the 

Requesting
 
State<p/>

person sought is in custody and the additional documents submitted are not
sufficient, or if such documents are not received within the period specified by
the

the rearrest and the extradition of the person if the additional documents are
subsequently received.</font><p/>

of urgency, either Contracting Party may request the provisional detention of

request and the documents mentioned in Article 9 are delivered later.</font><p/>
<p/><font>ARTICLE 12
Detention and Release</font><p/>
<p/><font>A person
detained pursuant to the Treaty shall not be released until the extradition

<p/><font>FOR THE 

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

:</font><p/>
<p/><font>President of
the 

United States of America

</font><p/>
<p/><font>FOR THE 

REPUBLIC
 OF 
COSTA RICA

:</font><p/>
<p/><font>President of

Republic
 of 
Costa Rica

</font><p/>
<p/><font>No. 202</font><p/>
<p/><font>

San Jos

 December 16, 1982.</font><p/>
<p/><font>His
Excellency Fernando Volio Jimez,</font><p/>
<p/><font>Ministry of
Foreign Relations, 

Republic
 of 
Costa Rica

</font><p/>
<p/><font>Excellency: I
have the honor to refer to the Extradition Treaty between the 
United States of America</font>

Republic
 of 
Costa Rica<p/>
<p/><font>Article 2 of
the Treaty broadly defines offenses which are extraditable in order to insure
that all felonies punishable under the laws of both Contracting Parties are
extraditable. During the negotiations, questions arose as to whether offenses
under certain complex 

United States</font><p/>
<p/><font>It is also
understood that fiscal offenses which may be punished by a maximum period of
deprivation of liberty in excess of one year in both States are extraditable
offenses under the Treaty.</font><p/>
<p/><font>Article 16 of
the Treaty sets forth the rule of speciality applicable to extradited persons.
Paragraph (1)(b) of that Article provides that a person who has been extradited
under the Treaty may be detained, tried, or punished in the Requesting State not
only for the offense for which that person was extradited, but also for an
offense of a lesser degree of culpability which is based on the same facts as
the offense for which extradition was granted. For example, this paragraph would
permit the 
Requesting
 
State</font>

Requested
 
State

. While the English and Spanish texts use different terminology in paragraph (1)
(b) of Article 16, it is understood that the terminology used has the same
effect in the legal systems of the 
United States
 and 

Costa Rica

.<p/>
<p/><font>I would
appreciate a note from your Excellency confirming that the understandings
described above are also the understandings of the Government of Costa Rica.</font><p/>
<p/><font>Accept,
Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest and most distinguished
consideration.</font><p/>
