I didn`t found a Adv. related to this so I decided to write one. :]

screen is vulnerable to a authentication bypass which allows local attackers
to gain system access in case screen was locked with a Password.

It has been tested on OpenBSD 4.1 + screen 4.0.3 on x86.

How to reproduce:

Lock screen using ctrl+x
Choose a Password
Confirm the Password

Screen asks for a Password to unlock the screen.
Just press ctrl+c.
2 seconds later the screen is unlocked and you`ve access.


Have fun!
